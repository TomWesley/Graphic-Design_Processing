# Processing_Java_Graphics
Processing Development Environment(PDE) files that create images and videos via the Processing Application. Scripting in this repository is entirely done in Java. Download the platform at https://processing.org/download/ and open/run the file in the application. To permanently save the output, see instructions in the PDE files about toggling the save() and saveFrame() protocols. PDE files contain the code and sample export images and video files are labeled with the same name followed by an underscore and a unique identifier.
